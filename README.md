# Damn Vulnerable Grade Management (DVGM) - An Intentionally Vulnerable Rails Application

Damn Vulnerable Grade Management is an **intentionally vulnerable** grade
management application that can be used for teaching *security testing* and
*security programming*. It aims to be a small application with a realistic use
case that contains common vulnerabilities, making it a good target to get
started with automatic security testing tools.

## Known Vulnerabilities

DVGM contains (at least) the following vulnerabilities:

* SQL Injection
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* DOM Based XSS / Client Side XSS
* Missing server-side input validation
* Insecure HTTP Headers
* Vulnerable dependencies

## Suggested Static and Dynamic Tools

We have tried many different tools to automatically find the vulnerabilities,
and found the following tools to work best for this kind of application. While
none of them finds all contained vulnerabilities, together they cover a
reasonable amount:

* [arachni (1.5.1)](https://github.com/Arachni/arachni)
* [zaproxy (OSWASP ZAP, 2.7.0)](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy)
* [brakeman](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman)

## Application Scenario

Damn Vulnerable Grade Management implements a simplistic system for managing
university grades. Students can upload assignments (pdf), view their grades for
their assignments and lectures, download their grades as reports, and add
comments to the grades which can be viewed by lecturers. The application knows
three roles: *admins*, *lecturers*, and *students*.

* *Admins* can create new students, lecturers, and other admins. Admins can
  create new lectures, held by any lecturer. Admins can also create, view, and
  edit new grades for all lectures and students and can create, view, and edit
  comments.
* *Lecturers* can create new students. They can also create new lectures that
  are being held by them. Lecturers can can view grades for all students, but
  only enter new grades for their own students. Lecturers can see comments for
  all grades, but can not change any.
* *Students* can upload assignments (pdf). They can also view and comment on
  their grades for their assignments and overall lectures. For their
  convenience, they have the ability to filter their grade list by a lecturer
  name.
* All roles are able to log into the system. They can also reset their password
  by providing the answer to their chosen security question.

You are Peter, a student and you can log in with `peter` as username and
`football` as password. Try and see how much information/control you can gain!

## Setup

### Dependencies

* Ruby 3.1 (and Raild 7) and [bundler](https://github.com/bundler/bundler)

### Checkout

The repository can be cloned as usual:

``` sh
git clone https://git.logicalhacking.com/BrowserSecurity/DVGM.git
```

Note, if you authorized to access the confidential solutions of the
exercises for DVGM, you can obtain them by executing

``` sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Installation

After cloning the repository, install the dependencies; `bundle` will install
all dependencies automatically into a project-local directory:

```bash
cd DVGM
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'
RAILS_ENV=development bin/rake db:populate
RAILS_ENV=production bin/rake db:populate
```

### Starting the server

To make exploration of the app a bit easier, we run DVGM in development mode.
This means that

* on errors, rails will return a detailed debug page, and
* changed source files will automatically be picked up, without needing to
  restart the server (useful for seeing if your fixes work).

Now, start the server:

```bash
bin/rails server
```

Now, open your browser, go to <http://localhost:3000>, and start exploring!
